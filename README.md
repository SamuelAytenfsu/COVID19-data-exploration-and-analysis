# COVID19-data-exploration-and-analysis
This project includes almost all step of data analyst which is starting from data exploration and end by building the data visualization using Tableau and done with the help of Alex data analyst social media. For this project I used data from <https://ourworldindata.org> which is different time to time so that the data set may have been changed at the source. 

The website has five sections and for this project we use only Deaths Section (How many deaths from COVID-19 have been reported? Is the number of deaths rising or falling? How does the death rate compare to other countries? ) and Vaccinations section (How many vaccine doses are being administered each day? How many doses have been administered in total? What share of the population has been vaccinated?). 

For the data exploration parts we create database and write queries by using sql server. The data visualization part is analyzed using tableau and shows some insights about the COVID-19.
You can see the visualization using this link: <https://public.tableau.com/shared/ZWTD6QMMB?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link>
